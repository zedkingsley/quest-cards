# Quest Cards — Vision

## The Soul

Quest Cards is a **growth engine for families** — not a chore tracker.

It's about **becoming**, not about **doing tasks**.

---

## Core Belief

> The best way to grow is through action, novelty, and reflection.
> - **Quests** = Try something new
> - **Experiments** = Test who you want to become

---

## What Quest Cards Is NOT

❌ A chore chart
❌ A to-do list for families
❌ A way to nag kids about responsibilities
❌ "Did everyone do their tasks?"

---

## What Quest Cards IS

✅ A way to celebrate **firsts** and **growth moments**
✅ A game that makes trying new things fun
✅ A tool for **personal experiments** (New Year's resolution style)
✅ A way for families to see what everyone is **working on becoming**
✅ Parents as **coaches**, not task-masters

---

## The Two Modes

### 🎯 Quests — Growth Moments

Quests are about **firsts** and **learning experiences**, not recurring obligations.

| ❌ This is a chore | ✅ This is a Quest |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Do the dishes | Learn to load the dishwasher |
| Cook dinner | Try a new recipe |
| Clean your room | Donate 5 things you don't need |
| Do homework | Teach someone what you learned today |

**The test:** Is this a novel experience that helps someone grow? If they've done it 100 times, it's not a quest — it's just life.

### 🧪 Experiments — Ongoing Trials

Experiments are **time-boxed behavioral trials** inspired by the scientific method.

Instead of goals ("lose 10 pounds"), experiments are specific and testable:
- "Two Mile Tuesdays" — run 2 miles every Tuesday for a quarter
- "Phone Sleeps Downstairs" — plug phone in downstairs every night
- "No-Spend Weekdays" — only spend money on weekends

**The lifecycle:**
1. **Hypothesis** — "I think doing X will help me become Y"
2. **Experiment** — Try it for a set duration (week/month/quarter)
3. **Check-ins** — Simple yes/no tracking with optional notes
4. **End** — Final check-in + "What's next?" prompt
5. **Iterate** — Keep it, modify it, or try something new

Experiments are never "completed" — they yield **insights**.

## The Family Dynamic

### Everyone Participates

- **Kids** do quests assigned by parents
- **Kids** can challenge parents to quests (role reversal!)
- **Parents** can do quests and experiments too
- **Everyone** can see what others are working on (visibility = accountability)

### Parents as Coaches

Parents aren't just task-assigners. They're **curators of growth**:
- Browse quest packs to find what's right for each kid
- Save quests to a **backlog** for later ("Wyatt isn't ready for this yet")
- Think about each child's unique journey
- Celebrate growth moments, not just completion

---

## The Rewards Philosophy

**Points** = Universal currency earned by growth
**Rewards** = Promises family members make to each other

- Kids earn points, redeem from parents' reward shops
- Parents earn points too, redeem from each other
- It's a family economy of mutual investment

---

## The Vibe

- Playful, not naggy
- Celebratory, not guilt-inducing
- Growth-oriented, not chore-focused
- Experimental, not perfectionist

---

## The Tagline Options

- "Grow together"
- "Family adventures in becoming"
- "Quests for growth"
- "Try new things. Become who you want to be."
